Good afternoon, today I want to introduce a new file format. Before the introduction, I want to ask a question firest: do you have a habit of taking notes or writing blogs? You may heard of Evernote or Jianshu. They all suppost this format to publish arcitles or notes. 

This format called markdown The file name of this format end up with md or markdown extension. I write my blog use this format. And it is useful and convenient.

First, what is the markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
The motivation for inventing this language was to write content for the web and make the content easy-to-read and easy-to-write.
Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation(标点符号) characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text.

Second, how does the markdown work?
To write Markdown content, you only need a simple text eidtor which support txt extension. That is because it’s written in “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like pounds (#) and backticks (`).

But if you want to see the formated content while you are writing, you need an editor which support markdown. But don't worry, there are many recommendations on the Internet.

Third, why markdown is popular?
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdown’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text. 
Text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics(学术), scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments. 

In china, there are some websites using markdown to write articles as well.Such as, jianshu, a blog community to share articles. Evernote，a famous tools to keep notes. And even more, we can use markdown to write subscription articles for wechat.

Finally, Is it diffcult to learn the markdown syntax?
No, not at all. Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve, it is very easy to learn. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text—stuff.

For example, surrounded with two asterisks will make the text bold, and starting with two pounds will create a level-two header, and starting with three pounds will create a H3 header, and so on.

Now, if you are interested in markdown, I recommend you a website 马克飞象, you can take a look at the official introduction.
