Good Afternoon, my dear colleagues. Today, I want to share my two drawbacks with you. Hope I can give you some inspirations or warnings. If you have the same feeling, you should also be aware of these two things.
First I wanna tell is the smartphone. Second I wanna talk about the helloworld.

Let me ask a question. What is the opposite word of work? You may say it is leisure, or vacation. Actually I don't think so. Leisure is a busy thing. you need to plan what to do and where to go spend your leisure time. The opposite of work is idleness.

We all spend much time on mobile phone, but I was worse. In my case, without smartphone, I can't taste the flavor of the food. So What do I watch on the mobile phone? I usually watch fragmentation news and entertainment shows. When you watching these, You feel comfortable and joyful, but your brain doesn't think deeply. And this is idleness. Every day, you feel no gains or no efficiency, that is because of idleness. When you get used to idleness, you will waste your concentration and lose your independent mind.

In my opinion, concentration is more valuable than time. Because we all have the same 24 hours each day, but for concentration everyone and every day is different. So don't waste your concentrations on your phone, or other fragmented information. And my solution is to put your phone far away from you, and spend at least 2 hours each day to stay alone. You can use this time to read a book, or to develop your own habit. And When you really concentrate on something, time flies.

Now, back to the second part, the helloworld. I guess all programmers know helloworld means. It's means a quick start of a programming language. As a software programmer, we need to learn different programming languages. We are very familiar with installing software, configuring development environment. Also, we know so many ways to say 'Hello world' using different languages. But we don't know what to do next after those elementary courses.

As far as I'm concerned, study is a lifelong work, we need to learn new knowledge to better ourselves. After coming through the quick start, we need use the new knowledge into practice. And don't assume you can use it very well at the beginning. In this using process, we need to accept our clumsiness(笨拙), and keep using it even if the result is not good enough.

For me, I found one way to use the new knowledge. I write blogs to keep notes. I hope this method can help you too.

That’s all, thank you!
