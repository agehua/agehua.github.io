Good afternoon, my dear colleagues.
Here is my self-introduction, if you heard something wrong, or you don't agree with, my apology!

My name is Conor. I choose Conor as my English name is because I have an idol who is a professional mixed martial artist and boxer named Conor McGregor. He is the only fighter to be champion in two Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) divisions simultaneously.

I come from Tangshan city in Hebei province which is not far away from Beijing. I like doing exercise, like running, Skating and swimming.

When it comes to the family life, I got married in October 7th last year. What is different between being married and single? My opinion is You have to do cleaning more often, and you have to say I love you ever day. In a word，you have to performance much better than you did when the time you pursuing her. If you don't ,she will say you have changed since we married. You don't love me anymore. Come on, I am a good guy, I love her, but I don't want to say it everyday.

As a software engineer, I like coding, I built my own blog on the github. And I wrote an Electronic wedding invitation based on a source code. I konw a joke, let's see can you all understand this: what is the difference between Java and JavaScript? The answer is Java and Javascript are similar like Car and Carpet are similar.

I also like traveling and I prefer to go to historic places. That is because you can enjoy the beautiful scenery and feel the history simultaneously. I have been to the city of Jincheng in Shanxi province. There is a temple called Qinglian temple which was built in Sui and Tang Dynasties. It was situated at the foot of a hill and beside a stream.

The temple has a lot of Buddha, but most of them are damaged. The staff there told me,the buddhas' hands and feet were cut off during the Revolution. When I went there, a big Buddha was being repaired, but many small Buddha statues were put aside, and nobody took care of them. The most impressive one was a small Thousands Hands Guanyin statue. It was badly destroyed and her right half of the body were disappered. Although her body was incomplete, the Buddha‘s face is still smiling.

What I want to say is althrough we have a long history and a rich culture in China which we are proud of. But we don't cherish them. We prefer to Glamorous things, but ignore the old-fashioned things. I hope every one can make an effort to protect our culture.

At last, I'd like to recommend a book called 《The path of beauty》(美的历程) in which you can have a Further understanding of our culture by the history timeline.
