My personal hexo blog: https://agehua.github.io. I use this blog to take notes on development knowledge, like android, Java, JavaScript and so on. 

The hexo theme was based on the [hexo-theme-icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus), and added some features which I prefer. You can take a look at the theme from here: https://github.com/agehua/icarus-Hexo-theme

Here is a screenshot for my blog :
