Good afternoon, today I want to introduce a new file format called markdown. The file name of this format end with md or markdown extension. I write my blog use this format. And it is useful and convenient.

First, what is the markdown? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. 
The motivation for inventing this language was to write content for the web and make the content easy to read and easy to write. 

Second, how does the markdown work?
To write Markdown content, you only need a simple text eidtor which support txt extension. That is because it’s written in “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like pounds (#) and backticks (`).

But if you want to see the formated content while you are writing, you need an editor which support markdown. But don't worry, there are many recommendations in zhihu.

Third, why markdown is popular?
Text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics(学术), scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments. 

In china, there are some websites using markdown to write articles as well.

Such as, jianshu, a blog community to share articles. 

Also we can use markdown to write subscription articles for wechat, or to keep notes in evernote.

And what's more, Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve, it is very easy to learn. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text—stuff like making things bold, creating headers, and organizing lists.

So, let me show you some examples.
