  "readme": "dir-resolve\n===========\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mwinche/dir-resolve.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mwinche/dir-resolve)\n\n## Purpose\n\nAn extension to `require.resolve()`. Traditionally, `require.resolve()` calls\nonly work if you're working with files, as opposed to directories. For example:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\n  module/\n    package.json\n    test/\n    index.js\n```\n\nYou could run `require.resolve('module')` or `require.resolve('module/package')`\nand it would return paths to the files you expected. However, if you ran\n`require.resolve('module/test')` it would throw an exception. Since\n`require.resolve()` is designed to be the underlying mechanism upon which\n`require()` works, this is good and expected behavior. After all, what does\nrequiring a directory even mean in node?\n\nThat said, I recently have had the desire of being able, to not `require()` the\ndirectories of my dependencies, but to get their locations via\n`require.resolve()` at which point this this behavior became a hindrance.\n\nThus, I have written `dir-resolve`. Meant to be an extension to\n`require.resolve()`, `dir-resolve` provides all the functionality of\n`require.resolve()` but adds the ability to resolve the directories of your\ndependencies as well.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install dir-resolve`\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar resolve = require('dir-resolve');\n\n//Assuming the example above is at /path\n\nresolve('module/package'); // -> '/path/node_modules/module/package.json'\n\nresolve('module/test'); // -> '/path/node_modules/module/test'\n```\n\nIn my testing it is compatible with Windows.\n\n## Development\n\nClone this repo and run `npm install` to run locally.\n\nTo run the tests do `npm test` or `npm test -- --watch`.\n",
